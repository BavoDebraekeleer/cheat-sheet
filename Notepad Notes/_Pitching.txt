Pitching
========

Rational and emotional

Emphasis and breaks, silence to emphasis

Repetition, repeat your core message, 7 times

Story
	characters
	challenge or hardship for the characters -> conflict
	setting
	story arch -> timing, build up
	solution

Clear and coherent
	
Message -> must be clear
	
No questions in a pitch

Why -> How -> What

Most common mistakes in a pitch:
	1) Dwelling on the problem
	2) No call to action
	3) Undermining your project -> be confident, positive, geen verkleinwoorden
	4) Stay vague -> Don't say it, show it! Show the product/service -> Steve Jobs pulling the iPod/iPhone out of his pocket
	5) Not translating your added value -> use a persona pov, add an object in your story, eg. an orange as a prop for a brain
	
Foundations of pitching, 3 takeaways:
	1) Connect
	2) Prepare
	3) Expectations and questions
	
	1) Connect
		Audience & Context
			-> the environment your pitching in and to whom
			-> what is the goal?
			-> adapt your message and story to the context you're in
			
		First impression
			Body language -> open posture, eye contact, loose and relaxed posture, use the room, smile :)

Connect through voice
	Tone
	Volume
	Speed
	Silence
	Pronunciation
	Stopwords
	Rythm.
