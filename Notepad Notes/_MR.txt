Project Mixed Reality
---------------------

Project keuze:
	1) Glasses off:
		You start in an empty white room, well lit, and put on the VR glasses.
		The VR world reflects this and you can walk around the space.
		By the end the VR world is completely dark except for a light with you (eg. Echoes of the Eye sim)
		When you take of the headset the room you started in is also completely dark with a light source with you,
		having the effect of making your surrounding feel super dark by the light shining in your eyes.
		
		To drive immersion further there is a secret in the real room that you learned in the VR room that you feel compelled to check.
		By making this secret actually real in the real world drives the experience home.
		
		More of an installation.
		
		Like the game Outer Wilds it's up to you to explore the room and find things out through environmental storytelling.
		This then teaches you the secret in the real world.
		
		eg.: Outer Wilds, Antichamber, Spider-Man: Far From Home
		
	2) Valpreventie
		You should feel panicky and your body temp goes down, this must be communicated visually.
		-> shivering can be with rumble in the controllers, as well as heartbeat
		-> slow build up in intensity, shift in colors in the VR world from calm to threatening.
		Time elapses by black-outs
	
	3) Environmental immersion
