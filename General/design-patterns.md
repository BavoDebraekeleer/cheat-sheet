## Introduction

A design pattern is a default solution for common design problems.

History:
- Flow Based Design using Flow Charts to visualize the design.
- Structured Programming says a structured code should have a single start- and end-point, with in between a set of modules.
- Object-Oriented Programming divides the functionality into objects with relations such as composition, references, and inheritance. Resulting in reusable, better readable, and better maintainable code.
- SOLID principles, largely by Robert C. Martin (uncle Bob).
- Today, it is crucial to work Agile, in close cooperation with the customer, and with quick adaptability to market and business strategy changes.

## Difference between a Pattern and a Principle

A **_Software Design Pattern_** is called a *pattern* because it suggests *low-level specific* implementation to a specific problem.

A **_Software Design Principle_** is called *principle* because it provides *high-level advice* on how to design software products.

## Factory Pattern

### OCP Simple Factory Pattern

In a factory pattern, you create an object without exposing the creation logic. An interface can be used for creating an object, but lets the subclass decide which class to instantiate. Rather than defining each object manually, you can do it programmatically.
In short, a factory is an object that creates other objects without the use of a constructor.
#### [Reflection](https://stackify.com/what-is-c-reflection/)

Reflection provides objects of type `Type` that describe assemblies, modules, and types. You can use reflection to *dynamically create an instance of a type*, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties. If you are using attributes in your code, reflection enables you to access them.

Instead of having a switch or if statements chain to create new objects, like in this example:
```c#
class MovieFactory
{
    public Movie Create(int movieType, string movie_name)
    {
        Movie movie = null;
        if (movieType == 1)
        {
            movie = new RegularMovie(movie_name);
        }
        if (movieType == 2)
        {
            movie = new ChildrenMovie(movie_name);
        }
        if (movieType == 3)
        {
            movie = new NewReleaseMovie(movie_name);
        }
        return movie;
    }
}
```

We can use *reflection*, using the `Activator.CreateInstance(Type...)` method.
This way, we don't need to modify this method every time a new type class is added.
```c#
class MovieFactory
{
    public Movie Create(string type, string movie_name)
    {
        try
        {
            Movie m = (Movie)Activator.CreateInstance(
	            Type.GetType(
		            $"SOLID_Start.Movies.{type}"), 
		            new Object[] { movie_name });
            return m;
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            return new NullMovie("null movie"); // Applying LSP
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Adapter Design Pattern

The use of an abstract superclass to provide a base type, while the subclasses implement their own interfaces. This way, instances can be called by type.

*Example:*
```c#
interface IWorker
{  
	void Work();         
}  
interface IBreaker  
{  
	void Break();  
}  
interface IHumanWorker: IWorker, IBreaker  
{  
}  
  
abstract class Workable  
{  
	public abstract void DoWork();  
}  
class Werkmier : Workable, IHumanWorker  
{  
	void Break()  
	{  
		Console.WriteLine("i take a break");  
	}  
	public override void DoWork()  
	{  
		Work();  
		Console.WriteLine("...");  
		Break();  
	}  
	public  void Work()  
	{  
		Console.WriteLine("i work");  
	}  
 
}  
class Robot : Workable,  IWorker  
{  
	public override void DoWork()  
	{  
		Work();  
	}  
	public void Work()  
	{  
		Console.WriteLine("I Work non stop");  
	}  
}  

class Manager  
{  
	List<Workable> werkers;  
	public Manager()  
	{  
		werkers = new List<Workable>() {  
			   new Werkmier(),  
			   new Werkmier(),  
			   new Robot()  
		};  
	}  
	public void Start()  
	{  
		foreach (var worker in werkers)  
		{  
			worker.DoWork();  
		}  
	}  
}
```

## Strategy Pattern

Strategy isÂ **a behavioural design pattern that turns a set of behaviours into objects and makes them interchangeable inside the original context object**. The original object, called context, holds a reference to a strategy object. The context delegates executing the behaviour to the linked strategy object.

In scenarios where you would have to change an object type, you would normally have to instantiate a new object of that different type and by doing so lose all possible data it holds.
By identifying what the reason is why you would have to change type, and encapsulating this into a strategy object, you now no longer have to change object type, but just switch out the strategy object.

*Adheres to OCP, or Open/Closed Principle, because you can add functionality without modifying existing code.*

### Movie Rental Example (using abstract classes)

#### Without Strategy Pattern

There are three subclasses of the abstract base class `Movie`.The only thing the subclasses implement is the `GetCharge` method, which basically returns the pricing. If, over time, we want to change the `Movie` type from `NewReleaseMovie` to `RegularMovie` we would have to instantiate a new object to only change the pricing, while losing all other data, in this case the title.

![[Pasted image 20230929101415.png]]

```c#
public abstract class Movie   
{   
	private string _title;   

	public Movie(string title)    
	{   
		_title = title;   
	}   

	public string GetTitle()   
	{   
		return _title;   
	}   

	public abstract double GetCharge(int daysRented);
}
```

```c#
class NewReleaseMovie : Movie   
{   
	public NewReleaseMovie(string title) : base(title) { }   
	   
	public override double GetCharge(int daysRented)   
	{   
		return  daysRented * 3;   
	}   
}
```

#### With Strategy Pattern

By applying the Strategy Pattern, we identified why we would have to change the object type, being the pricing, so introduced the `Price` strategy object as a property of `Movie`.
This way, when a `Movie` object changes from `NewRelease..` to `Regular..`, only the `Price` property has to change from `NewReleasePrice` to `RegularPrice`, while the `Movie` object and all its other data, like title, are kept.

![[Pasted image 20230929101431.png]]

```c#
public class Movie
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public Price PriceType { get; set; }

    public Movie(string title)
    {
        this.Title = title;
    }

    public double getCharge(int daysRented)
    {
        return this.PriceType.getCharge(daysRented);
    }
}
```

```c#
public abstract class Price   
{   
	public abstract double getCharge(int daysRented);
	// abstract, so subclasses HAVE TO provide their own implementation.

	public virtual int getFrequentRenterPoints(int daysRented)
	// virtual, so subclasses CAN provvide their own implementation.
	{   
		return 1;   
	}   
}
```

```c#
class RegularPrice : Price   
{   
	public override double getCharge(int daysRented)   
	{   
		double result = 2;   
		if (daysRented > 3)   
			result += (daysRented - 2) * 1.5;   

		return result;   
	}   
}
```

```c#
public class NewReleasePrice : Price   
{   
	public override double getCharge(int daysRented)   
	{   
		return daysRented * 3;   
	}   

	public override int getFrequentRenterPoints(int daysRented)   
	{   
		return (daysRented > 1) ? 2 : 1;   
	}   
}
```

```c#
class PriceFactory // Applying OCP = Open/Closed Principle
{
    public Price Create(string type)
    {
        try
        {
            Price p = (PrijsT)Activator.CreateInstance(
	            Type.GetType($"SolutionName.FolderName.{type}Price"), 
	            new Object[] { });
            return p;
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
	        // Applying LSP = Liskov Substituation Principle
            return new NullPrice("null price");
        }
    }
}
```

### Unity Game Example (using an interface)

Using an interface.

Instead of implementing the `DoDamage` method in the base class, it is moved to an interface `IDoDamage`. This interface is then used as a property in the base class, so subclasses can set the `damageType` in their constructor. This way, the `TryDoAttack` method only needs to be implemented once in the base class, and no modifications, or overrides in the subclasses are necessary. 
The different types of damage are separate classes that implement the `IDoDamage` interface.
The `?` `null` check in `TryDoAttack` also allows for weapons that don't do any damage.

![[Pasted image 20230928163436.png]]

New types of damage can easily be added, without having to modify the base class or the `TryDoAttack` method. The damage type can also easily be interchanged, for example, to allow for modifiers which change the damage type of a weapon.

![[Pasted image 20230928163732.png]]

Instead of making separate subclasses for different damage types, you can also make a more generic subclass that gets the damage type as a constructor parameter, instead of hard coded.

![[Pasted image 20230928163758.png]]

If you want the ability to add multiple damage types per weapon, you can make the property into a list. Where you then step through.

![[Pasted image 20230929093323.png]]

*Note: the base class inherits from `MonoBehaviour`, because this is a Unity example, and this makes it easier to attach to a button in Unity.*

## Dependency Injection Pattern

***Dependency Injection*** is a technique to add dependencies to a class *when* the class requires it, but maintaining a *loose coupling*.

Dependencies are:
- References required to compile
- References required to run

Common dependencies:
- Third party library
- Database
- File system
- Web Service
- New keyword

The main problem this pattern aims to solve is how to create âloosely coupledâ components. It does that by separating the creation of components from their dependencies.

There are fourÂ main roles (classes) in this pattern:
1. **Client.**Â The client is a component/class that wants to use services provided by another component, called a Service.
2. **Service-Interface.**Â The service interface is an abstraction describing what kind of services the Service component is providing.
3. **Service.**Â The Service component/class is providing services according to Service-Interface description.
4. **Injector.**Â Is a component/class that is tasked with creating Client and Service components and assembling them together.

The way it works is that the Client is dependent on Service-Interface IService. The client depends on the IService interface, but has no dependency on the Service itself. Service implements the IService interface and offers certain services that the Client needs. Injector creates both Client and Service objects and assembles them together. We say that Injector âinjectsâ Service into Client.

Class Diagram:
![[Pasted image 20231005085829.png]]

```c#
public interface IService {
    void UsefulMethod();
}
public class Service: IService {
    void IService.UsefulMethod() {
        //some usefull work
        Console.WriteLine("Service-UsefulMethod");
    }
}
public class Client {
    public Client(IService injectedService = null) {
        //Constructor Injection
        _iService1 = injectedService;
    }
    private IService _iService1 = null;
    public void UseService() {
        _iService1?.UsefulMethod();
    }
}
public class Injector {
    public Client ResolveClient() {
        Service s = new Service();
        Client c = new Client(s);
        return c;
    }
}
internal class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        Injector injector = new Injector();
        Client cli = injector.ResolveClient();
        cli.UseService();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

Three types of Dependency Injection:
- Constructor injection *(Preferred)*
- Method injection
- Property injection

#### Example Case

The following example is a violation of DIP, because the *high level module* `Printer` is dependent on the concrete `EventLogWriter` class.
```c#
class EventLogWriter  
{  
    public void Write(string message)  
    {  
        //Write to event log here  
    }  
}

class Printer  
{  
    // Handle to EventLog writer to write to the logs.
    EventLogWriter writer = null;
    
    // This function will be called when the app pool has a problem.
    public void Notify(string message)  
    {  
        if (writer == null)  
        {  
            writer = new EventLogWriter(); // new keyword = dependency
        }  
        writer.Write(message);  
    }  
}
```

### Constructor Injection *(Preferred)*

An instance of the concrete class is passed to the dependent class via *the constructor*.
Use this injection type if the concrete class is used during the whole lifecycle of the dependent class.

The constructor of a class should contain all dependencies the class needs. These are called *explicit dependencies*. Otherwise, they are *hidden* dependencies.

It is the preferred injection type, because it:
- Follows the *Explicit Dependencies Principle*.
- Classes are never in an uninitialized state.
- Can leverage special factory types, called IOC or DI container, to construct types and their dependencies.

***Explicit Dependencies Principle***: dependencies listed in the constructor can't surprise clients.
Compare it to ingredients in a recipe. You want to know all ingredients beforehand by them being listed in the ingredient list. You don't want to find out about *new* ones later on in the recipe text.

An IOC (Inversion Of Control) container, is the same as a DI (Dependency Injection) container, or simply *services* container. This container is able to resolve the dependencies of your classes at runtime. ASP.NET Core has a built-in container. A third-party container is [Autofac](https://autofac.org/).


```c#
class Printer  
{  
	INotification writer;  
	public Printer(INotification logger)  
	{  
		writer = logger;  
	}  
	  
	public void Notify(string message)  
	{              
		writer.Notify(message);  
	}  
}
```

```c#
static void Main(string[] args)  
{  
	EventLogWriter log = new EventLogWriter();  
	Printer p = new Printer(log); // log instance injected in the constructor.
	p.Notify("dit is een test");  
	Console.ReadLine();  
}
```

### Method Injection

An instance of the concrete class is passed to the dependent class via a *method call*.
Use this injection type if the dependent class uses multiple concrete classes for the same method.

```c#
class Printer  
{  
	INotification writer;  
	public Printer()  
	{  
	}  
	  
	public void Notify(INotification logger, string message)  
	{              
		logger.Notify(message);  
	}  
}
```

```c#
static void Main(string[] args)  
{  
	EventLogWriter log = new EventLogWriter();  
	Printer p = new Printer();  
	p.Notify(log,"dit is een test"); // log instance injected in a method.
	Console.ReadLine();  
}
```

### Property Injection

An instance of the concrete class is passed to the dependent class via a *set property*.
Use this injection type if the concrete class should be swappable, without having to be passed to a method every time.

```c#
class Printer  
{  
	// Handle to EventLog writer to write to the logs.
	public INotification writer { get; set; }
	
	// This function will be called when the app pool has a problem.
	public void Notify(string message)  
	{  
		writer.Notify(message);  
	}  
}
```

```c#
 static void Main(string[] args)
 {  
	EventLogWriter log = new EventLogWriter();  
	Printer p = new Printer();  
	p.writer = log; // log instance is set to the property writer of the Printer.
	p.Notify("dit is een test");  
	Console.ReadLine();  
}
```

## Singleton Pattern

The purpose of Singleton Pattern is to create only one common access to an object, which means the class can only have on instantiation.

Singleton: Single instance shared across the application.

A singleton object is created only once during the lifetime of an application, and the same instance is shared by all components that require it. Subsequent requests for the object will return the same instance. This pattern is useful for objects that should have a global and shared state across the application.

_Example: Letâs say you have a logging service that needs to be accessed by multiple components in your application. By registering the logging service as a singleton, all components will share the same instance, ensuring consistent logging behavior across the application._

*Singleton Pattern Diagram:*
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:382/1*546cgD2MFxHPKib3FFAZGw.png)

### Why WOULD you use a Singleton?

[Singleton Design Pattern in C# by Scott Lilly](https://scottlilly.com/c-design-patterns-the-singleton-pattern/)

You might want to use the singleton pattern for classes that use an external resource, and there might be problems if multiple objects try to use that resource at the same time. For example, the file system, a database server, a web service, etc.

If your program needs to do logging, you may want all output to be written to one log file. That could lead to resource conflicts and errors.

![Without a singleton, each business object has its own logging object.](https://www.scottlilly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WithoutSingleton.png)

With a singleton logger object, you donât need to worry about several different objects trying to write to the same file, at the same time.

![With a singleton, the business objects share a single logging object](https://www.scottlilly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WithSingleton.png)


### Why WOULDN'T you use a Singleton?

Another option is to use a global, or static, class. But that usually leads to bad programming practices. After a while, those classes tend to hold a lot of unrelated information and objects.

This can still happen with singletons, which is why some programmers say singletons are an â*anti*-patternâ â a bad programming practice.

There are times when singletons can be useful. However, like many programming decisions, you need to consider the positives and negatives.

Plus, you can more easily create âmockâ versions of your singleton class, for unit testing. This is difficult to do with static classes.


### Implementation

TheÂ **singletonÂ [design pattern](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/design-patterns-in-java)**Â is used to restrict a class to only one instance at a time. This restriction is achieved by changing the accessibility of the constructor toÂ `private`Â so that a new instance cannot be created using that constructor from outside the class. TheÂ **[static](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-use-static-keyword-in-java)Â method**Â **`GetInstance()`**Â (defined in the class) creates a new instance after checking if an instance already exists. If it does, the same instance is returned; otherwise, a new instance is created and returned. TheÂ **static variable**Â **`instance`**Â keeps track of the existing instance of the class.

#### Static Initializer Singleton Pattern (C# Only!)

Guarantees an instance gets created and multi-thread safe.

Pattern:
```c#
class ClassName
{ 
	private static readonly ClassName _instance = new ClassName();
	
	private ClassName() { } // private Constructor
		
	public static ClassName GetInstance() // public static method
	{
		return _instance; 
	}
}; 
```

#### Multi-Thread Safe Method

Pattern:
```c#
class ClassName
{ 
	private static ClassName _instance; // private static field
	private static readonly object _syncLock = new object();
	// _syncLock is just an object for the lock to hold on too, nothing special.
	
	private ClassName() { } // private Constructor
		
	public static ClassName GetInstance() // public static method
	{
		if (_instance == null) // Check if an instance already exists
		{
			lock(_syncLock) // The first thread call gets a lock on next code
			{
				_instance ??= new ConsoleMessengerSingleton();
			}
		}
		return _instance; 
	}
}; 
```

#### NOT Multi-Thread Safe Method

Pattern:
```c#
class ClassName
{ 
	private static ClassName _instance; // private static field
	
	private ClassName() { } // private Constructor
		
	public static ClassName GetInstance() // public static method
	{
		if (_instance == null) // Check if an instance already exists
		{
			_instance = new ClassName(); // Create a new instance
		}
		return _instance; 
	}
}; 
```

Shorter version:
```c#
class ClassName
{ 
	private static ClassName _instance; // private static field
	
	private ClassName() { } // private Constructor
		
	public static ClassName GetInstance() // public static method
	{
		return _instance ??= new ConsoleMessengerSingleton();
	}
}; 
```

*Example:*
```c#
#include <iostream> 

using namespace std; 

class Singleton
{ 
	private static Singleton* _instance; // private static field
	
	private Singleton() // private Constructor
	{ 
		cout << "New instance created!" << endl; 
	} 
		
	public static Singleton* GetInstance() // public static method
	{
		// Check if an instance already exists: 
		if (_instance == nullptr)
		{
			_instance = new Singleton(); // Create a new instance
		}
		return _instance; 
	} 
}; 

Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr; 

int main()
{ 
	// Private default constructor can't be accessed: 
	// Singleton* s = new Singleton(); 
	
	Singleton* s = Singleton::getInstance(); 
	Singleton* t = Singleton::getInstance(); 
	
	// Print address of where 's' and 't' point 
	// to make sure that it is the same object: 
	cout << "'s' points to: " << s << endl 
	<< "'t' points to: " << t << endl; 
	
	return 0; 
}
```
