## Introduction

Front-end library (not a framework) developed by Facebook to render complex UI in a Single Page App (SPA). â€” `react` and `reactDOM`.

![[Pasted image 20231024173136.png]]

Next.js, for example, is a framework that uses the React Library.

A React App is a tree of components that are represented in JavaScript code.
It is 100% component based.
All React apps start by rendering a single component.

Uses React JSX Syntax among normal JS code.

### Functioning of React

- At app start the component in `/pages/index.js` is launched.
- That `index.js` contains the root element of the React app.

React maintains state for every component.
State changes cause apps to re-render with an updated UI.

Can not use JavaScript `let` to update data.

### Toolchains for React

- Next.js
- Create React App (CRA)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

### Data between Parent and Child

- Passing data from parent to child, is through React element attributes.
- Passing data from child to parent, is by passing functions to child that get executed by that child component.

### React Server Components

React Server Components (RCS) are components that run inside a Node Server.

Components running on a server have (direct) access to different things:

## React Hook

A way to track data changes over the lifetime of a component.

## React UI Library (Styling Library)

Building UI components from scratch can be tedious and sometimes futile. This is why component libraries exist; they provide ready-to-use design elements, thereby allowing developers to focus on building the UI without building everything from scratch.

Options:
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)

### Material UI

[Installation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/):
```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @fontsource/roboto
npm install @mui/icons-material
```
